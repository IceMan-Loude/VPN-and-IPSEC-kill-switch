# VPN-and-IPSEC-kill-switch
This is justa test and use case for python automation
Introduction
The key goal behind this project was to create a Python automation system that would enforce essential network security features. The automation tool aimed to provide VPN verification simulation, together with firewall policy execution and session hijacking inspection, and individual IP traffic detection, followed by automatic countermeasures issuance. The project adjusted its scope because Google Colab restricts access to system-level modifications and the detection of actual VPNs, so the solution was shifted to operate inside simulated circumstances that uphold real implementation principles.
The project presents a functional system that enables security automation capabilities for VPN reliability checks and intrusion detection operations. Monitoring networks through automated enforcement systems proves vital to fighting security risks in remote and cloud-based solutions.
Development Process
Planning
The first stage of development involved determining the core functional components necessary for a secure and responsive network automation system. These included:
VPN status validation
A “kill switch” trigger to simulate blocking all outbound traffic if VPN integrity fails
Session hijacking detection via Apache log monitoring
IP-based rate limiting to flag potential abuse
We planned for the system to run continuously, with each component operating either in real-time or on scheduled loops.
Design  
Given the cloud environment (Colab), we chose a modular Python script with the following design logic:
VPN Check (Simulated): Hardcoded country check to simulate geolocation-based VPN validation.
Kill Switch: Logs a critical message when VPN status fails.
Log File Simulation: Fake Apache logs are generated dynamically.
Session Hijacking Detection: Monitors for IP inconsistencies tied to session IDs.
Rate Limiting: Detects IPs making an excessive number of requests.
Each section was split into a Colab cell to ensure easy execution and demonstration. Extensive logging was added to simulate real-time feedback.
Implementation
Using Python, each function was implemented with simulation in mind. For instance:
Instead of fetching real-time geolocation using APIs (blocked in Colab), we mocked a country return.
We replaced iptables commands with log outputs to demonstrate the action without actual system calls.
Apache log entries were faked and written to a local file in Colab, which was then parsed for signs of session hijacking or abuse.
The final notebook was sectioned logically:
Configuration
Logging setup
VPN validation
Kill switch
Session hijacking monitor
Abusive IP detection
Monitoring loop
This structure made the system maintainable, readable, and replicable across environments.
